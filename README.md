# MATLAB code for simulating and solving model selection 'mines' common in neuroscience

## Description

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating and solving example model selection and cluster analysis problems common in neuroscience.

The figures of 'Navigating the statistical minefield of model selection and clustering in neuroscience' by Kir√°ly & Hangya can be produced with the main_msacl function. Figure 2d relies on publicaly humna RNA-sequencing data (https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/human-multiple-cortical-areas-smart-seq).
